In the preface to Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Abelson and Sussman state

> “First, we want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a way of
> getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal medium
> for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written for people to
> read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”
