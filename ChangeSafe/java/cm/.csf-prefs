# Support for non-portable file-system operations.
#
# SET_FILE_READ_ONLY should be a command line that can be used to set
# a file to read-only status.  The ChangeSafe java client will invoke this
# command on a filename in order to make the file not-writable.
#
# SET_FILE_READ_WRITE should be a command line that can be used to set
# a file to read-write status.  The ChangeSafe java client will invoke this
# command on a filename in order to make the file writable.
#
# GET_FILE_EXECUTABLE should be a command line that can be used to query
# if a file is executable.  The ChangeSafe java client will invoke this
# command on a filename in order test if the file is executable.
# This only makes sense on unix-like file-systems that have an
# executable bit - it has no effect on MS-Windows.
#
# SET_FILE_EXECUTABLE should be a command line that can be used to set
# a file to executable status.  The ChangeSafe java client will invoke
# this command on a filename in order to make the file executable.
# This only makes sense on unix-like file-systems that have an
# executable bit - it has no effect on MS-Windows.
#
# SET_FILE_NOT_EXECUTABLE should be a command line that can be used to
# set a file not-executable.  The ChangeSafe java client will invoke 
# this command on a filename in order to make the file not-executable.
# This only makes sense on unix-like file-systems that have an
# executable bit - it has no effect on MS-Windows.
#
# SET_FILE_LAST_MODIFIED should be a command line that can be used to
# change the timestamp on a file.  The ChangeSafe java client will invoke
# this command on a filename in order to set the timestamp on the file.
# There is no native command on Windows that can do this, but there
# are several ports of the unix touch program that can do this.  Be
# aware that some touch programs expect the date in CCYYMMDDhhmm.ss
# while others use MMDDhhmmCCYY.ss
#   If you don't want ChangeSafe to maintain timestamps, simply do not
# specify a command for changing the timestamp.
