The following step is required once per machine installation of the development
environment.

0) Ensure that you have generated a certificate key called 'ContentIntegrityTest'.
   
   This is a one-time per machine step (assuming you don't sack your Netscape
   installation), and is described in the document 'signing.doc'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

The following steps are required every time you change java code which runs as
as signed applet in browsers.

1) Compile the classes with the COMPILE-JAVA.BAT file, resulting in classes\*.class files.

   This should be readily automated in the TS-LOAD function, but hasn't been done yet.

   COMPILE-JAVA.bat and lisp-internal invocations of 'javac' assume that the CLASSPATH
   environment variable includes '.', and that '.' for purposes of compilation is the
   \ts50\server directory.

2) Sign the classes with the SIGN-CLASSES.BAT file, generating the FSTestApplet.jar file.

   This step assumes that you've generated certificate keys as per the procedure
   documented in 'signing.doc'.

   This should also be automated, but it isn't straightforward.

   You must feed in your Netscape certificate database password and user database
   location, which varies by machine and user.  Assuming you can figure out where the
   database location is, and that you know the password, the location is passed with -d,
   and the password with -p.  Usage.html has details (I had to cut and past this from a
   netscape site frame, since they don't appear to publish the documentation for signtool
   in downloadable form).

   For now, I've copied essential certificate key files from my machine
   (in the "D:\Program Files\Netscape\Users\Default" directory)
   and put them in the signtool directory. These files require the password
   "implementer", which is used in the sign-classes.bat file.

  -rw-rw-rw-   1 dave     5           98304 Dec  9 19:55 cert7.db
  -rw-rw-rw-   1 dave     5           16384 Dec  9 19:55 key3.db
  -rw-rw-rw-   1 dave     5           16384 Dec  9 19:55 secmod.db

  So the sign-classes.bat file will use these certificate databases to sign the
  classes, and you don't absolutely have to have done step (0) (maybe, I haven't tested
  this assumption) before doing step (1).

HACK HACK HACK:

Classes are compiled into the 'classes' subdirectory for purposes of producing a signed
applet.  They are compiled into the 'server' directory for purposes of running the
application oriented test harness.  The 'class' files are generally identical, if they've
been compiled with the same switches.
