BUG						WHO	STATUS
-------------------------------------------	-------	-------

RS00	000710-0000				JRM	Resolved - Customer error

    files still writeable after master_change/cset_close
    (.csf-prefs was incorrect with respect to chmod)

RS01	000710-0013				JRM	Fixed v0.231

    co should work with relative paths crossing subsystem boundaries

RS02	000710-0014				JRM	Fixed v0.231

    co should work from relative path above subsystem

RS03	000710-0015				PWW	Fixed V0.253 [JC13 is Duplicate]

    co->rename->co of file doesn't refresh file as per spec
    [JDT: Spec may be bogus here]

RS04	000710-0016				PWW	Done V0.275

    co twice of same file in succession should fail the second attempt

    JDT: Right now we just warn.  This seems ok to me.
    Perhaps related to possible spec flaws in RS03.
    PWW: we now give an error

RS05	000710-0017				PWW	Done V0.275

    co operation not correct if file to be co'd is writable at time of operation
    (not spec compliant, should give error, probable regression test impact for test-14)

RS06	000710-0018				GeoB     Deferred (RS10 is duplicate of this)

    This particular bug is in error code reporting, stemming from the fact that the
    command line parser isn't signalling errors compatible with other args.
    It's not quite a duplicate of JC01.

RS07	000710-0019				PWW	Deferred, reply to hp pending

    If same cset name is created immediately after closing a first
    time, then the operation succeeds and spec says it should fail.

    JDT: right now we detect this on cset_close instead of cset_create,
    it would be nice to do it on cset_create, but we'll leave it this way for now.
    Note that by deferring to cset_close, the name may in fact be unique at that time,
    since its system-qualified value will be different and perhaps unique where it wasn't before.

RS08	000710-0020				PWW	Fixed V0.255

    If create then close a cset in one product context, then create
    the same cset name under a different product context, the
    specification says that a warning should be returned.

RS09	000710-0021				PWW	Done V0.275

    [JDT: contradiction in spec: cset_create warns, "co" errors, issue sent to hp]
    [JDT: See \\change\e$\bugs\rs09jdt.txt]

    When creating a cset and giving a list of files to check out
    such that at least one of the files isn't a file currently
    under control in this context, then the specification says
    the cset should be created.  It is not.
    Signal a warning, not an error. 

RS10	000710-0022				Duplicate of RS06

    Running master_lock with no options outputs a message
    that -description is needed.  It also has a return code
    of 102, which is not in the return code document.

RS11	000710-0023				GeoB	TBD

    Not a bug, return codes in doc are meaningless
    As long as we return warning, we're ok.
    Warning reporting cleanup related to bug JC01.

    Running master_unlock in a workspace that has no locks
    gives a return code of 100, when document says that it
    will give a return code 3 (only a warning)

RS12	000710-0024				BILL	In-Progress

    [JDT: Ade signed off on this in the May-31 deliverables, apparently he was confused.
     The tests look somewhat WRONG in use of mixes of products, classes, and subsystems
     in unlock_force commands.]

    master_unlock -force doesn't handle -product or -class arguments 

	I set up two workspaces on the same product, and
	create work in one of them, and do a master_lock.

	I then go to the other workspace and do a
		master_unlock_force -product myprod -class C1

	and get a message saying 'no -subsystem specified'.

	The spec lists "-subsystem | -product -class"

    warnings/errors not returning correct codes (reporting mechanism needs serious
    rearchitecture, return codes should probably be limited to 0/1)

JC02	000710-0001				PWW	Fixed v0.236

    `-ws' argument to ws_delete and ws_move was causing confusion.
    And incorrect ws deleted if ws_delete called from another ws.

    database create semantics differ on remote/local databases
      (i.e., remote requires directory exists, local requires
       directory not exist)

    						George	Resolved, Workaround
    (1) Address space full (PSR).  Workaround given (OS_AS_SIZE)

						George  TBD
    (2) Update and check in hpux-install-notes,
	we need to document this parameter for customers anyway.

JC06	000710-0005				Arol/George	In-progress *****

    ***** Reproduction attempts suspended until we try the following:
    1) Have jack run the broken build with PHSS_17225 installed.
    2) Have jack reproduce the problem with a new build.
    3) Have jack send us the test input files he used with the test script that he sent
       us, since it doesn't work for us (at least not on the latest dog food build).

    ws_set doesn't delete undesirable leftover files (same for ws_regenerate)

    Customer Severity(1-hi; 5-lo):  2

    -- Details --

    ws_create a workspace for product P1
    ws_set -product P2

    After the above sequence, the workspace should look like P2, with P2's
    files and directories. Instead, it ends up looking like the union of P1
    and P2, including all files that are in either product.

    -- Suggestion --

    Delete files and directories of P1.
    Wild files should be left behind, but all change-controlled P1 files
    should be removed from the file system.

    ws_regenerate should do the same.

JC08	000710-0007				GeoB	Deferred/Fixed?
    [JDT: Jack is now unable to reproduce the problem]

    One of two servers gives err msg Database directory xxx already exists

    Severity(1-hi;5-lo): 4 

    -- Details --

    Installed CS servers on two machines, with more or less identical config
    files.

    Ran the same command on both:
    COMMAND: con admin_database_create -db-directory
    c###.sdd.hp.com:/local/ODI/database/img/ img7-6c

    On both machines, there already exists a directory
    /local/ODI/database/img

    On machine c819, received the normal warning:
    Unable to verify that database directory does not exist on remote
    server c819.sdd.hp.com.
    Master repository creation completed with warnings.

    On machine c796, received this error:
    An error occurred while attempting master repository creation:
    Database directory #p"c796.sdd.hp.com:/local/ODI/database/img/" already
    exists

    ... Now I've got a problem with this error, in that the database
    directory is *supposed to exist*. Plus of course, the issue of getting
    different behavior from the two servers. 

JC09						N/A	Not-A-Bug

    JDT: "-d" is speced to be "description", not "-database".  User error.
    George and Jack have resolved this together.

	Summary		"-d" option misbehaves in ws_create

	Severity(1-hi;5-lo): 4

	-- Details --
	Server was started using the new alias commands, i.e.
	(conman:do-param-alias-create "d" "description") ... and so forth

	This command 
	con ws_create -d c819.sdd.hp.com:/local/ODI/database/img/img1 -p avalon
	ws_img1f
	Gives this error
	An error occurred while attempting workspace creation:
	No product (ever) named "avalon" exists

	This command
	con ws_create -database c819.sdd.hp.com:/local/ODI/database/img/img1 -p
	avalon ws_img1f
	Creates the workspace without complaint

	Only difference is substitution of "-d" for "-database"!

	(I do have a .csf file in my home directory that points to a different
	db, where the product "avalon" apparently doesn't exist.)


JC10	000711-0000				Mark	Fixed

	Listing says "Chechout" instead of "Checkout"

	Only the file I co'ed should be writable.

	(If I do not include the file name in the "cset_create" and do a
	separate "co", only the one file is writable.)

	File system permissions are pretty important. People use them to know
	what they are doing. It's also a confidence factor that the system is
	treating their files right and not messing with them.

    cset_remove: Unable to remove a cset specifying only one class

    First I create a cset that affects two different classes 
    (add a file, one to each class).

    Next, I try to remove this same cset from only one class (using
    -class name) in a different workspace.  However, the cset is
    removed from all affected classes.
