    <h1>Notes about the CONMAN Port operation</h1>

    <h1>What's What</h2>

    <p>
      We must distinguish between the following entities (HP's terms):
    </p>

    <dl>

      <dt><b>subsystem delta</b></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>
	  A subsystem delta resides in a satellite repository and
	  describes changes to objects in that repository.
	</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>delta</b></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>
	  A delta is a change set in the master repository which
	  affects objects in the master repository.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Each delta relates to some set of subsystem deltas.  This
	  relationship is captured in the CSET-RELATIONSHIP-TUPLES of
	  the MASTER-CATALOG.
	</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>transaction</b></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>
	  The set of transactions is a subset of the set of deltas.  A
	  delta is a transaction if it alters the CID-OBJECTS slot of
	  a version.  Thus transactions are deltas which affect the
	  promotion and demotion of changes in a product branch.
	</p>
      </dd>

    </dl>

    <p>
      The function VERSION-LIST-CSET-CHANGES will return a list
      describing each transaction and its affected deltas.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>
	For the product or subsystems being ported from, we need some
	sense of a baseline before which changes will not be
	considered for porting, otherwise we will need to keep track
	of what changes have been rejected for all time.
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>
	Is this right:
      </i>
      It is the subsystem deltas which are either <tt>port</tt>ed,
      <tt>defer</tt>ed or <tt>reject</tt>ed during the course of the
      port operation.  Though the user interface provides similar
      operations on transactions and deltas, they are merely a
      convenience for operating on a bunch of subsystem deltas
      en-mass.
      <b>Answer:</b>
      Right.  Port is driven ENTIRELY by subsystem activity, which is
      correlated into high level transaction activity (where possible,
      when all *applicable* affected subsystems are present/relevant)
      to make it more tractable for the end-user.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>
	Once the port operation is complete, is the state of the
	product in the master repository altered or just the
	workspace's virtual private branch?
      </i>
      <b>Answer:</b> Port affects only the workspace.  No action is
      taken in the master until MASTER_CHANGE is executed against the
      workspace.
    </p>

    <h2>terms and conditions defined in the specification</h2>

    <p>
      <b>Choosible</b> means the item merits a port/defer/reject radio
      button group.
    </p>

    <p>
      subsystem delta is <b>available</b> if:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>not rejected</li>
      <li>port relationship exists</li>
      <li>current port operation limited to exclude this subsystem</li>
      <li>project has write permission for subsystem</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A subsystem delta is <b>choosible</b> if it is <b>available</b>
      and is not already in the workspace.
    </p>

    <p>
      A delta is only <b>visible</b> in the port report if it has
      <b>available</b> subsystem deltas.
    </p>

    <p>
      A transaction is only <b>visible</b> if it has <b>visible</b>
      deltas.
    </p>

    <p>
      If all of the subsystem deltas in a delta are <b>available</b>
      the delta itself is <b>choosible</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If all the deltas in a transaction are <b>choosable</b> then the
      transaction is <b>choosable</b>.
      </p>

    <p>
      There is a distinct difference in appearance between items which
      are not <b>choosible</b> and items which are not <b>available</b>.  The spec
      says that unavailable items do not have port/defer/reject radio
      buttons, while those that are available but not choosible have
      buttons but they are greyed out.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spec also provides for a mode in which previously rejected
      satellite cset dids can be reconsidered:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Finally, you can invoke the GUI to see only the transactions and
      csets that have previously been rejected (with the “No” choice).
      This is a way to “unignore” csets you have previously rejected.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      We interpret this to mean that in this mode such changes are
      <b>available</b> even though they were rejected.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will commonly refer to this mode of operation as
      <b>resurrection mode</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spec gives no indication of how such changes should be
      treated if the inheritance relationship of the subsystem for
      which the change was rejected is changed or if the rejected
      change is portable from another subsystem different from the one
      from which it was originally rejected.
    </p>

    <h2>the port to product page</h2>

    <p>
      Various factors affect whether a change is shown on the port UI
      page and how it is shown.  For satellite csets, these factors include

    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	whether the change is already present in the workspace's view
      </li>
      <li>
	whether the change was rejected by port activity in a previous
	change
      </li>
      <li>
	the inheritcance relationship between the subsystem being
	ported from and the subsystem being ported to
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Based on these criteria, the user interface decides on the
      appearance of the change set's description and, what control the
      user has over its porting, and what will be sent back in the
      response concerning the change's porting (via a hidden input
      field in the case of port-all, for example).
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	the change might or might not appear on the port UI page
      </li>
      <li>
	if the change appears, it might have port/defer/reject buttons
	or not.
      </li>
      <li>
	submitting the port UI form might or might not tell the server
	how to process the change.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      An entry will appear in the port user interface only for changes
      which are <b>visible</b>.
    </p>


    <p>
      Based on the rules from the spec listed above, we can fill in
      this table.
    </p>

    <table border=1>

      <tr>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
	<th>Available</th>
	<th>Visible</th>
	<th>Choosible</th>
	<th>Electibile</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
	<th>Transactions</th>
	<td>
	  <i>not specified</i>
	</td>
	<td>
	  if any deltas are <b>visible</b>
	</td>
	<td>
	  if every delta is <b>choosible</b>
	</td>
	<td rowspan=2>
	  consider <b>electibility</b> of subordinates:
	  <ul>
	    <li>If any are <i>present</i> then <i>nil</i>
	    <li>if not in resurrect mode and any are <i>reject</i> then <i>nil</i>
	    <li>if any are <i>port selective</i> then <i>port selective</i>
	    <li>else nil
	  </ul>
	</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
	<th>Deltas</th>
	<td>
	  <i>not specified</i>
	</td>
	<td>
	  if any subsystem deltas are <b>available</b>
	</td>
	<td>
	  if every subsystem delta is <b>available</b>
	</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
	<th>Subsystem Deltas</th>
	<td>
	  <ul>
	    <li>not rejected
	    <li>port relationship exists
	    <li>product can modify subsystem
	    <li>within scope of port operation (e.g. class not excluded
	  </ul>
	</td>
	<td>
	  if containing delta is visible
	  <i>(assumed, not clearly stated in specification)</i>
	</td>
	<td>
	  <b>available</b> and not already present in workspace
	</td>
	<td>
	  <ul>
	    <li>if already present then <i>present</i>
	    <li>if previously rejected and not in resurrection mode then <i>spurned</i>
	    <li>otherwise <i>port all</i>, <i>port selective</i> or
	    <i>no port</i> according to disposition
	  </ul>
	</td>
      </tr>

    </table>


    <p>
      In the CONMAN specification, <i>port all</i> changes are not
      considered by the port user interface but are assumed to be
      handled separately, so the <b>choosible</b> property as
      specified doesn't apply to them.  Since our implementation
      handles the <i>port all</i> and <i>port selective</i> changes
      together, we need to further distinguish between these cases.
      For what appears in the "button area" of an entry, we would like
      to distinguish among these cases:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> the change is <i>port all</i> and does not require buttons

      <li> the change is <i>port selective</i> and does require buttons

      <li> the change is already present in the product

      <li> the change is to a subsystem which is not a component of
      the product being ported to
    </ul>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, the CONMAN spec's concept of <b>choosibility</b>
      is not suitable to distinguish these cases so instead we
      introduce the concept of <b>electibility</b> as described in the
      table above.
    </p>


    <p>
      How a delta is displayed is based on how its component satellite
      change sets are displayed.  How a transaction is displayed
      depends on how its subordinate deltas are displayed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spec dictates that the transactions and deltas should have
      buttons which serve as a convenience feature so that the user
      can use these buttons to operate on all subordinates in the same
      way.  Since I don't have the JavaScript expertice to achieve
      this behavior, for now neither transactions nor deltas will have
      buttons.  They will only serve to provide context for the
      satellite changes.
    </p>

    <h2>Issues</h3>

    <p>
      What if subsystem inheritance, porting action or subsystem use
      change during port activity, for example, between using the port
      user interface and the <tt>port -act</tt> command?
