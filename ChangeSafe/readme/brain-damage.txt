This is a list of the various fixes and workarounds of Franz bugs that 
currently exist in the product.  SPR's are provided when known.

-----
Bug:
    Arrays of type unsigned-byte 24 or signed-byte 24 are promoted to
    -byte 32 arrays rather than type T arrays.  This is a performance
    problem because it unboxes and shifts the data when storing into
    the array and boxes and shifts the data when retrieving, where if
    it kept the data as a boxed fixnum, it could simply store and
    fetch.

SPR .....
    Noted a while ago, but unfixed.  Franz seems reluctant to fix
    this.  They argue that promoting to unsigned-byte 32 is a legal
    promotion. (It is, but so is T, and promoting to T produces faster 
    code).

Fix/Workaround:  
    Change declarations of 
       (simple-array (unsigned-byte 24) (*)) to (simple-array t (*))
       (simple-array (signed-byte 24) (*)) to (simple-array t (*))

-----
Bug:
    Franz ignores inline declarations.  Although it is technically
    allowed to do so by ANSI standards, ignoring inline declarations
    is simply lame.

No SPR
    Franz argues that inline declarations could be abused (see
    documentation).  This is true, but there are a lot of things in
    Lisp that could be abused, and they provide _them_.  It is much
    more likely that they simply punted on implementing INLINE and use 
    this as a rationalization.

Fix/Workaround:
    Macro DEFSUBST provides sufficient functionality, and
    DESTRUCTURE-FUNCTION-LAMBDA is provided for writing beta-reducing
    compiler macros.  Both of these macros are portable.

-----
Bug:
    Race conditions in multitasking code.
    Incorrect implementation of WITH-OPEN-FILE, WITH-OPEN-STREAM, and
    UNWIND-PROTECT, and EXCL:RUN-SHELL-COMMAND.

SPR 21833    
    Fix sent to Franz, but they have not responded.
    
Fix/Workaround:
    Add *DEFER-INTERRUPTS* flag, and a process to
    deliver deferred interrupts.  Advise MP::INTERRUPT-BREAK to check
    deferred interrupts flag.  Provide macros
    WITH-DEFERRED-INTERRUPTS,
    UNWIND-PROTECT-WITH-DEFERRED-INTERRUPTS, and shadow
    CL:WITH-OPEN-FILE and CL:WITH-OPEN-STREAM with definitions that
    cause interrupt deferral.  (We shadow these symbols because their
    use is rather pervasive.)
    On windows, define foreign functions that can manipulate win32
    process handles.
    Wrap EXCL:RUN-SHELL-COMMAND with CALL-SYNCHRONOUS-SUBPROCESS
    function that ensures process and stream cleanup.

    While this code is peculiar to Franz, most lisp systems offer
    similar functionality (with similar bugs, too).


-----
Bug:
    USER-HOMEDIR-PATHNAME always returns "C:\\" on Windows NT.
    
SPR 21944
    Franz says fix may be forthcoming in 6.0

Fix/Workaround:
    Replace Franz function EXCL::USER-HOMEDIR (which provides the
    functionality for CL:USER-HOMEDIR-PATHNAME) as follows:

    (defun nt-home-directory ()
      "Return the users home directory as NT understands it."
      (make-pathname :device (subseq (sys:getenv "HOMEDRIVE") 0 1)
	             :directory (sys:getenv "HOMEPATH")))

    (defun nt-home-directory-namestring ()
      (namestring (nt-home-directory)))

    (eval-when (:load-toplevel :execute)
      (without-package-locks
       (setf (symbol-function 'user-homedir)
             (symbol-function 'nt-home-directory-namestring))))

    And use the following function in TS50:

    (defun home-directory-pathname ()
      "Return a pathname which unambiguously indicates the current home directory of the
    user."
      #+(and allegro mswindows)
      (nt-preserve-pathname-case
       (make-pathname :device (subseq (sys:getenv "HOMEDRIVE") 0 1)
		      :directory (sys:getenv "HOMEPATH")
		      :defaults nil))
      #-(and allegro mswindows)
      (truename (canonicalize-pathname (user-homedir-pathname))))

-----
Bug:
    Last byte in (unsigned-byte 8) arrays is not preserved by
    allegrostore. 

SPR ??????

Fix/Workaround:
    We add padding to the end of binary files (which are stored as
    unsigned-byte 8), so that the last byte contains no useful data.
    The variable *BINARY-FILE-PADDING*, currently set to 1, specifies
    the padding to add.  This can be removed once the bug is fixed.

-----
Bug:
    On Unix, Franz attempts to prevent use of the pathname device
    slot by forcing the device slot to be NIL or :UNSPECIFIC when you
    call make-pathname.

SPR ??????
    Franz simply refuses to fix this.  They argue that this behavior
    is allowed by the ANSI spec, but it is easily seen from the spec
    that a STRING (the value we wish to put in the slot) is a legal
    value despite the fact that such a pathname may not be useful to
    the file system.  (note that the host slot is also of no use to
    the file system, yet it can be set)

Fix/Workaround:
    Advise MAKE-PATHNAME to SETF the EXCL::.PATHNAME-DEVICE slot after 
    constructing the pathname normally.  This is somewhat gross, but
    since we are using the named slot `.PATHNAME-DEVICE' rather than
    some slot index, it is actually reasonably robust.

----- 
Bug:
    RENAME-FILE fails to rename directories on the new machines with
    the latest Franz software.

SPR 21854
    Franz cannot reproduce this, but we can.  It is rather worrisome.

Fix/Workaround:
    Use a foreign function call under Windows NT to directly call the
    Win32 MoveFileEx function.  There is only one place in ts50 that
    uses RENAME-FILE:  the file-system-rename method on the
    lisp-file-system.  The workaround is therefore installed in the
    error handler for FILE-SYSTEM-RENAME.

-----
Bug:
    No way to modify file permissions or file time.  (ANSI doesn't
    define a way, but there are no extensions to Franz, either).

NO SPR
    This is likely to be a problem for any lisp we use, and the
    solution is somewhat portable as any lisp we use should have
    subprocess capability.    

Fix/Workaround:
    Scan file system for CHMOD or ATTRIB.EXE executable, use
    RUN-SYNCHRONOUS-SUBPROCESS to invoke them.

    On windows, use foreign functions to access Win32 GetFileTime and
    SetFileTime functions.

    On unix, we should shell out to the TOUCH command, but we don't do 
    that yet.  (needs to be done!)
    
-----

Bug:
    Franz file copier only copies text files and doesn't preserve
    dates.

NO SPR
    See above.    

Fix/Workaround:
    Scan file system for CP or CMD executable, use
    RUN-SYNCHRONOUS-SUBPROCESS to invoke.

-----

Bug:
    The TAIL-CALL-SELF-MERGE-SWITCH is ignored in the compiler (it
    erroneously looks at TAIL-CALL-NON-SELF-MERGE-SWITCH), so
    LABELS statements do not compile tail-recursively when they
    should.

SPR ?????
    Should be fixed at some point.  We will continue to use the macro, 
    however, because although all commercial lisps define a mechanism
    for ensuring tail-recursion, they differ in implementation.

Fix/Workaround:
    TAIL-LABELS macro binds COMPILER:TAIL-CALL-NON-SELF-MERGE-SWITCH
    during the compilation of each label body.

    This macro has two mechanisms for working around this bug.

-----

Bug:
    PROBE-FILE does not return filenames with the NT preserved
    canonicalized capitalization.

NO SPR
    This seems to be a deficiency in the Win32 API.    

Fix:
    Use NT-PRESERVE-PATHNAME-CASE which deduces the correct
    capitalization. 

-----

Bug:
    No way to control which database is used consing encoded NON-CLOS
    objects pointed to by persistent objects.
    
NO SPR

Fix/Workaround:
    Switch to ASTORE:DATABASE-OF owning object just before calling
    ASTORE-FLUSH-SLOTS. 

-----

Bug:
    No way to store host information (like platform) in pathnames.

NO SPR
    Given that Franz refuses to fix the device bug, it is unlikely
    that they will want to extend pathnames to include this
    information. 

Fix/Workaround:
    db-name objects used for naming databases on remote machines.

-----

Bug:
    Network (socket) errors are signalled as if they were file errors, 
    and details of the error are missing.

SPR ?????
    Don't know if this has been reported to Franz.    

Fix/Workaround:
    Look at the FILE-ERROR-PATHNAME in the signalled error.  Sockets
    have fixnums for their pathname, so if we find a fixnum there, we
    assume it is a socket error.  Furthermore, we assume it is a
    dropped connection, but who knows.

----

Bug:
    Franz lisp indenter has bugs.  Names beginning with DEF and WITH
    are assumed to DEFINITIONS and MACROS, even if they appear in
    binding lists.

NO SPR
    This hasn't been reported to Franz.

Fix/Workaround: 
    Make sure WITH doesn't appear first in a binding list by either
    re-ordering the binding list, misspelling WITH, or adding an
    unused binding.

-----

Bug:
    Franz doesn't officially support ADD-LOOP-PATH for extending LOOP.

SPR ?????    
    Don't know if this has been reported to Franz.    

Fix/Workaround:
    Use internal Franz definition, and provide abstraction layer in
    case ADD-LOOP-PATH disappears.  (considered unlikely)
