Subject:          Auto version selection

On some of the HTML pages, you have a drop down box for selecting the
version.
You can have the page auto-refresh when changing the selection (as opposed
to a button)
by assigning a name to the form that the drop-down box is part of, and an
onChange method to the select that creates the drop-down box.

<form name="TypeFormloc" method=get action="">

<select onChange="TypeFormloc.submit()">
