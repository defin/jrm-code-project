The following HPUX 10.20 kernel configuration parameters are likely to
affect ChangeSafe server operation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EQMEMSIZE	  - 400 minimum recommended.

Insufficient EQMEMSIZE is typificed by /usr/sbin/dmesg entries like the
following:

Pid 10350 got a bus error due to lack of alias pdir entries

It may also cause "recursive signal 10" behavior in the ChangeSafe server.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAXDSIZ, the maximum size of the data segment, recommended minimum value:
0x30000000 (768 MB). 

MAXSSIZ, the maximum size of the stack segment, recommended minimum value: 
0x4000000 (64MB)

SHMMAX, the 'max shared memory segment', recommended minimum value: 
0x10000000 (256 MB).

Inadequate values for these kernel configuration parameters will generally
result in the HPUX OS killing off both the ChangeSafe application server
process (which will typically register a recursive signal 10 error), as
well as the ObjectStore Cache Manager process that runs on the same machine
as the application server.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NFLOCKS should be proportional to at least twice the number databases
you expect to have open.  Note that every master database has an associated
semipersistent database, and one database per 'class'.  So a product in use
with 100 subsystems will have 102 databases open, and you should anticipate
NFLOCKS value of at least 204.  

MAXFILES should be greater than or equal to NFLOCKS.

Inadequate values for these parameters will cause the database server
to return exceptions to the application server (which is a client of the
database server).  When encountered, these exceptions are often reported to
the user, and may be confusing to the user who may think they have
too many files open on their client workstation, and not understand that
the problem really lies with the machine running the database server.
