			      ------------------------------

Deferred to next cycle (and due next cycle, not a complete list of due elements):
Deferred for one of two reasons:
(1) Because feature requires release manager commands not yet implemented.
(2) Because it's creeping featurism, but necessary featurism, and wasn't
    strictly required per the agreement, but is required to make product 
    workable.

   ws_update - handle subsystem additions/deletions
   ws_create -label -release
   product_create -label -release
   subsys_create -label -release
   ws-update -label
   file_add -force
   file_rename -force
   csets_from_file 
   description_replace
   ws_regenerate
   ws_move
   ws_query 
   product_directory_move
   product_directory_regenerate

   + rest of release manager commands.   

			      ------------------------------

			       Miscellaneous Feature Notes.

* PORT

  We support the browser-based product report, but no back end processing of PORT yet.
  This is the 'first half'.

* REPORTS

  - The PORT report is implemented (but not the back end)

  - The product composition and history report is implemented.

  - The delta report is a stub.

  - The change history report is a stub.

* CSET_CLOSE, MASTER_CHANGE

  - The -ADC-IMPORT switch is not yet operational.

			      ------------------------------

				   General Limitations

* Verbosity settings (-v0, -v1, -v2) generally aren't observed yet

* We don't yet detect inappropriate defaulting of various arguments in .conman
  (possibly because of workspace context)
  (particularly important for product code and release manager commands)

* Read-only bit setting isn't handled yet (we've got partial support, but not yet visible
  to user)

* Subsystem additions/removals to/from a product are not reflected in product reference
  directories or workspaces in a timely manner.

* The product is way too noisy any time it maintains disk files, we need to quiet the
  'publish' options for -v0, -v1.  Noise is probably ok for -v2.

* Some error messages still refer to csets as deltas.

			      ------------------------------

			       Command Specific Limitations

* CSET_CLOSE

    - Doesn't find files which were checked out AND renamed in the same change.

    - May not work correctly unless you execute it from the workspace root
      directory because of some overzealous pathname mangling.

* CSET_CREATE

    - Will signal an error if ws isn't up to date, but won't automatically do a ws_update.
      JDT is beginning to wonder if this might be the preferred behavior.  

    - -ABSTRACT argument  not yet supported.

    - File specifications for initial checkouts give a confusing (though
      accurate) error message if instead wild files were specified.

	conman-366: csf cset_create -name "initial load part 1" *.lsp
	No such file #p"REPOSITORY:CLOSOPT.LSP" in project "ts50"
	An error occurred while attempting cset creation:
	No such file #p"REPOSITORY:CLOSOPT.LSP" in project "ts50"
	conman-367: csf cset_create -name "initial load part 1"      
	Cset creation completed successfully.
	conman-368: csf file_add *.lsp
	File addition completed successfully.

* DATABASE_CREATE

    - In adding support for remote databases, we discovered at the last
      minute that this command now requires a trailing "/" on the database
      directory name.  (This will be fixed, as will all limitations)

* FILE_ADD

    - -TEXT, -BINARY switches not yet implemented.  Currently auto-detecting file type.

* PRODUCT_CREATE

    - -BASE-PRODUCT <xxx> not yet supported.

    - -COPY-FILE <yyyy> not yet supported.

    - -TIME probably isn't semantically correct, (HP question #74 TBR next meeting)

* SUBSYS_CREATE

    - Doesn't support the optional positioanl subsystem argument, right now it's required.

    - Doesn't support the -base-product argument, use -base-subsystem instead
      since they're effectively aliases.  Subsystem cset derivation from preexisting
      subsystems isn't well tested yet.

    - -date-time processing hasn't been tested.

    - Doesn't yet support the -subdirectory parameter.

* UNCO

    - Doesn't notice when you specifiy files that are not in the repository.
      (i.e. ignores wild files accidentally typed in unco file list).

* UNDO

    - FILE_RENAME doesn't work unless the file was just added.

    - FILE_REMOVE not yet supported.

* WS_DELETE

    - It can't delete a workspace by pathname yet only by ws_id.
      (This basically means you need to be IN the workspace
       or nap the ws-id out of its .conman file)

    - If the workspace being deleted has an open change which adds
      a file and then renames it, the renaming of the file isn't undone 
      when the workspace is removed.

* WS_QUERY, WS_REGENERATE, WS_MOVE

    - Not yet implemented.  These user command were added late in the spec cycle. 

* WS_SET

    - Not deleting past product file structure, only adds/updates for now

    - Not handling workspace VPB correctly if change-add/remove effects are present

    - Not creating logical subsystem directory substructure if there are no files
      present in the subsystem view.

    - Deletes wild files in subsystems

* WS_UPDATE

    - -REPORT isn't complete.

    - -DATE-TIME not yet implemented.
