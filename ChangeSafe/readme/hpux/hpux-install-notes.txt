The following environment variables currently affect ChangeSafe server
operation in its capacity as an ObjectStore database client.

OS_ROOTDIR		     [REQUIRED]

    This variable must always be set to point to the ObjectStore
    installation on those machines hosting either ObjectStore servers
    or ObjectStore clients (which are ChangeSafe servers).
    It typically it points to /usr/local/ODI/OS5.0.

SHLIB_PATH		     [REQUIRED]

    SHLIB_PATH must include $OS_ROOTDIR/lib.

OS_CACHE_SIZE		     [RECOMMENDED - see OS_COMMSEG_SIZE]

    This is the single most important environment variable governing
    ChangeSafe server performance.

    The size, in bytes, of memory used to cache data from the database.
    Usually the larger the better.  Values greater than 64MB (65536000) on
    HP/UX 10.20 require updating values of the OS_COMMSEG_SIZE and
    OS_COMMSEG_RESERVE_SIZE variables because of a bug in ObjectStore 5.0
    SP4 (and supposedly fixed in ObjectStore 5.1).

    On Unix platforms, the cache memory is mapped via 'mmap' into the
    ChangeSafe process.  A file which is sized according to this value
    (which defaults to 8MB if absent) is allocated in the directory
    indicated by OS_CACHE_DIR, or /tmp/ostore if OS_CACHE_DIR is not set.
    Thus /tmp/ostore should have sufficient memory to allocate files of
    size OS_CACHE_SIZE (and a few others).

    Example posix shell setting of this variable:

    $ OS_CACHE_SIZE=65536000
    $ export OS_CACHE_SIZE

OS_CACHE_DIR			[OPTIONAL - depends on OS_COMMSEG_DIR]

    This variable conrols the location of memory mapped cache files.
    It specifies the pathname of a directory, which MUST NOT be NFS
    mounted.

    Cache and commseg files must reside in the same directory, see
    OS_COMMSEG_DIR. (Why there are two variables which must be in sync
    is beyond our control).

OS_COMMSEG_DIR			[OPTIONAL - depends on OS_CACHE_DIR]

    A rediculous variable which should always be equal to the value of OS_CACHE_DIR.

OS_COMMSEG_SIZE			[OPTIONAL - depends on OS_CACHE_SIZE]
				[	  - see OS_COMMSEG_RESERVE_SIZE]

    Default: 270 KB

    Specifies, in bytes, the initial size of the communications segment
    (commseg). You must specify an integer that is a multiple of the page
    size.

    We're not precisely sure what ODI thinks the page size is on HP/UX.  We
    suspect it's 1024 bytes, and we've used that in sample calculations
    below. (This based on guesswork applied to the result of an OSSIZE
    command against a database).

    The commseg is a preallocated region that holds ObjectStore internal
    data (global data, cache indexing info, and data that describes
    databases and segments used by the application).  The size of the
    commseg depends on the size of the cache file.

    Theoretically, when you modify the size of the cache file as needed and
    ObjectStore adjusts the size of the commseg. However this is broken on
    AIX and HP/UX platforms, and must be done by hand.

    The basic formula for commseg size requirements, roughly, is that
    you need:

    - At least 2000 bytes constant overhead
    - Plus 84 bytes times the number of pages in the cache
    - Plus 840 bytes for each segment you use or create.
      Note that every client of the database causes a commseg to be created
#     (???)
    - Plus a bit more for each Server you use and for each database
      you use (ODI is unspecific here, guessing pagesize bytes per database)

    Example 1: A 128MB cache as specified with OS_CACHE_SIZE and assume
    one-kilobyte pages =
    (+ 2000			; constant overhead
       (* 84 (* 128 1000))      ; 84 bytes times number of pages, which
                                ; equals 128MB/1024
       (* 840 200)		; assume 200 users of the database server
       (* 200 1024)             ; assume 200 HP databases
       (* 1 1024)               ; and one database server
       1024)                    ; plus pagesize bytes to ensure we don't
                                ; round below necessary amount with
				; pagesize rounding

    The above adds up to 11128848 bytes.

    (JDT: The following is from ODI docs, and doesn't make sense to me...)
    Example 2: for 15,000 segments, assuming an 8 MB cache, which is 2048
    four-kilobyte pages, you can expect to need about 12732840 bytes (12.7
    MB) of commseg.

    Specifying a value below the minimum size needed to store required
    structures in the communications segment has no effect.  If necessary,
    ObjectStore rounds down the number you specify to a page-size boundary,
    that is, a multiple of the page size.   THIS IS ALSO BROKEN, AND MUST
    BE MAINTAINED BY HAND.

    Example posix shell setting of this variable:

    # set to 32MB
    $ OS_COMMSEG_SIZE=33554432
    $ export OS_COMMSEG_SIZE

OS_COMMSEG_RESERVE_SIZE		[OPTIONAL - depends on OS_COMMSEG_SIZE]

    The maximum size, in bytes, to which the COMMSEG can grow.  It should
    be equal to or larger than OS_COMMSEG_SIZE.  It defaults to 8MB.

    Example posix shell setting of this variable

    $ OS_COMMSEG_RESERVE_SIZE=33554432
    $ export OS_COMMSEG_RESERVE_SIZE

OS_AS_SIZE			[optional]

Specifies the maximum size of the persistent virtual memory address
space.

If you receive an "out of address space" message try increasing the
OS_AS_SIZE. Sizes of 500mb are not unheard of.

The SHLIB_PATH environmental path must include the <Allegro
directory>, as well as /usr/lib. If the ObjectStore installation
choice that creates links in /usr/lib was not selected, then it must
also include the ObjectStore lib subdirectory, $OS_ROOTDIR/lib.
