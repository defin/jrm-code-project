This memo describes the April 03, 2000 release of ChangeSafe (version
0.101).  This should be considered a pre-alpha release and should not
be used for production work.

Implemented in this release are the following elements of the Version 3.3
Command Descriptions (subject to limitations noted below):

- Essential Commands (section 3)
- User Commands (section 4)
- Product Code Manager Commands (section 5)
- A potentially non-compliant DATABASE_CREATE command from section 7.

		      ------------------------------
			      Overall Status

The release is nearly (but not quite) achieved critical mass from the
formal feature standpoint of sections 3-5, and we have tests for most
of the features in this regard.  A pass was made to bring commands up
to date with the command specification with regard to syntax and
features.  The first browser capabilities have been added to the
product. (See notes on server operation in order to access these
features).

The product is not yet ready for anything but evaluation use.

Change-set representations in the repository are believed to be correct,
however disk file management is still messy, and ws_update is not called
automatically when necessary (though errors will be signalled if a
ws_update is necessary).

Effects of cset_add and cset_remove on a workspace with an open cset
are not well tested.

The agreed upon ADC import modes are implemented, and a secret switch
"-ADC-IMPORT"  has been added to cset_close and master_change commands.
We believe this should be working now.

		      ------------------------------
			   Software Requirements

- HP/UX 10.20

- [MAYBE] OS Patch PHSS_17225 dld.sl(5) cumulative patch
  (We're not sure about this one: you may not need it, we're running it)

- Objectstore 5.1 SP4
  (assumed installed already this release, and not in the distribution)

- Files in this distribution.

		      ------------------------------
		       Miscellaneous Feature Notes.

* PORT

  This release includes an initial implementation of "port -act".  The
  port user interface does not yet rule out previously rejected
  changes, and does not yet rule out changes which already have effect
  in the workspace's baseline product/branch.  Other than that, we
  think port should be working.  We do not yet have an automated test
  suite for it or for any of our reports functionality, so it has not
  been rigorously tested.

* REPORTS

  - The workspace report is mostly implemented.  It does not currently
    report the names of added and removed changes correctly.

  - The PORT report is implemented (but not the back end)

  - The product composition and inheritance report is implemented.

  - The delta report is a stub.

  - The change history report is a stub.

* CSET_CLOSE, MASTER_CHANGE

  - The -ADC-IMPORT switch is believe to be working now.

* ObjectStore 

  - We've discovered that large values of OS_CACHE_SIZE are completely
    broken, we're working with Object Design (now Exceloncorp) for a fix.

    This release was tested with an OS_CACHE_SIZE of 65536000 bytes,
    which seems to work.  Don't forget that this variable can have a
    dramatic effect on ChangeSafe server performance.

		      ------------------------------
			    General Limitations

* Verbosity settings (-v0, -v1, -v2) generally aren't observed yet

* We don't yet detect inappropriate defaulting of various arguments in
  .conman (possibly because of workspace context) (particularly important
  for product code and release manager commands)

* There is some support for file read-only protection in this version

* Subsystem additions/removals to/from a product are not reflected in
  product reference directories or workspaces in a timely manner.

* The product is way too noisy any time it maintains disk files, we need to
  quiet the 'publish' options for -v0, -v1.  Noise is probably ok for -v2.

* Many parts of the system still think they're "CONMAN" instead of
  "ChangeSafe".  We're working on it.

* Product installation and configuration is grossly lacking in all respects
  (Hiring ads appear in papers tomorrow, soon we'll have people to start
   and/or finish all this stuff!)

* Some error messages still refer to csets as deltas.

		      ------------------------------
		       Command Specific Limitations

* CSET_CLOSE

    - Doesn't find files which were checked out AND renamed in the same
      change.

    - May not work correctly unless you execute it from the workspace root
      directory because of some overzealous pathname mangling.

* CSET_CREATE

    - Will signal an error if ws isn't up to date, but won't automatically
      do a ws_update.  JDT is beginning to wonder if this might be the
      preferred behavior.

    - -ABSTRACT argument not yet supported.

    - File specifications for initial checkouts give a confusing (though
      accurate) error message if instead wild files were specified.

* DATABASE_CREATE

    - In adding support for remote databases, we discovered at the last
      minute that this command now requires a trailing "/" on the database
      directory name.  (This will be fixed, as will all limitations)

* FILE_ADD

    - -TEXT, -BINARY switches not yet implemented.  Currently
       auto-detecting file type.

* PRODUCT_CREATE

    - -BASE-PRODUCT <xxx> not yet supported.

    - -COPY-FILE <yyyy> not yet supported.

    - -TIME probably isn't semantically correct, (HP question #74 TBR next
       meeting)

* SUBSYS_CREATE

    - Doesn't support the optional positional subsystem argument, right now
      it's required.

    - Doesn't support the -base-product argument, use -base-subsystem
      instead since they're effectively aliases.  Subsystem cset derivation
      from preexisting subsystems isn't well tested yet.

    - -date-time processing hasn't been tested.

    - Doesn't yet support the -subdirectory parameter.

* UNCO

    - Doesn't notice when you specifiy files that are not in the
      repository.  (i.e. ignores wild files accidentally typed in unco file
      list).

* UNDO

    - FILE_RENAME doesn't work unless the file was just added.  Undo
      currently only knows how to undo the renaming of a file that was
      added in the current change.

    - FILE_REMOVE not yet supported.

* WS_DELETE

    - It can't delete a workspace by pathname yet only by ws_id.
      (This basically means you need to be IN the workspace
       or nap the ws-id out of its .conman file)

    - No effort is made to delete empty directories.  This is just a
      temporary limitation.

    - If the workspace being deleted has an open change which adds
      a file and then renames it, the renaming of the file isn't undone 
      when the workspace is removed.

* WS_QUERY, WS_REGENERATE, WS_MOVE

    - Not yet implemented.  These user commands were added late in the spec
      cycle.  The information that WS_QUERY would provide is available from 
      the workspace report.

* WS_SET

    - Not deleting past product file structure, only adds/updates for now

    - Not handling workspace VPB correctly if change-add/remove effects are
      present

    - Not creating logical subsystem directory substructure if there are no
      files present in the subsystem view.

    - Deletes wild files in subsystems.      **** WARNING! ****

* WS_UPDATE

    - -REPORT isn't complete.

    - -DATE-TIME not yet implemented.

		      ------------------------------
		      Running the ChangeSafe Servers

To run the command server, which listens on port 7999, invoke 'conman.exe'.

To run the browser-based report server, which listens on port 8000, invoke
'conman.exe -- -http'.

The conman.exe file is part of the distribution.

Included in the distribution are example shell scripts for starting
the servers.  They might need tweaking for your installation though.

		      ------------------------------
	       Accessing Remote ObjectStore Database Servers

We've done some work to ensure that remote access to ObjectStore database
servers works.  One of two techniques are required in order to have a
-database name work when it refers to remote databases.

The first and easiest technique is simply to NFS mount the disk which
hosts the databases.  When databaes are accessed via NFS-mounted
pathnames, the ChangeSafe server will attempt to work with an
ObjectStore database server which resides on the machine hosting the
NFS-mounted disk.  The database files are not accessed over NFS.  NFS
is just used as a means of finding the right server.

The second and slightly more difficult technique requires that you instruct
the ChangeSafe server as to the names and platform types of remote systems
hosting the database and the ObjectStore database server.  To instruct
ChangeSafe, you must edit the 'conman-server-config.lsp' file.  This file
contains documentation on the format of entries.  It must be present in the
current directory containing 'conman.exe', so that it will find the file
upon startup and register the information.  A sample configuration file is
present in the distribution.

With this release, it is now possible to run the ChangeSafe server on
a different machine from the ObjectStore server.  The previous release
required than an ObjectStore server be running on the same machine as
the ChangeSafe server even if ChangeSafe was only accessing
ObjectStore databases hosted on a different machine.  This restriction
has been lifted.  There is some configuration which must be performed
to run the ChangeSage and ObjectStore servers on different machines:

  - The file astore13.adb must be on a file system which is accessible
  to the ObjectStore server.

  - The UNIX environment variable AS_CONFIG_PATH must be set in the UNIX
  environment which will be inherited by the ChangeSafe server
  process. In the Bourne Shell or similar, do

      AS_CONFIG_PATH=<host>:<directory>
      export AS_CONFIG_PATH

  where <host> is the name of the host which is running the ObjectStore
  server and <directory> is the directory (as would be accessed from
  software running on that host) containing the "astore13.adb" file.

This configuration still requires the modifications to
'conman-server-config.lsp' as described above.
