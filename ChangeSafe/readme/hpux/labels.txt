Key things to know about labels.

1) They are simple product-wide alias for date-time specifications.

   This is what we've implemented, non versioned, mutually exclusive with date-time.
   Product-wide, not per branch.

   We could have implemented this per-branch, but HP didn't originally care, and it was a
   small upgrade requiring subtyping of vm::branch objects to maintain conman::release
   specific label bindings since the data wasn't versioned, and therefore couldn't be
   viewed under branch context.  I feel they should be able to be per branch.

2) There is a better way to handle time aliasing:

   As time aliases, it would be simpler in some ways to simply have classes of 'alias' of
   which labels are time aliases, such that they could be used as -DATE-TIME arguments,
   and thereby eliminate all LABEL parameters.

   If we suppose existence of an ALIAS commands like this:

       alias_create alias-type alias-name
       alias_assign alias-name alias-value

   Where alias-type is one of {-date-time, -command, -parameter},

   Then we have a generic facility for defining aliases for components of command syntax,
   which doesn't alter any command syntax.
   
   This would be my preferred approach for the current label implementation of date-time aliases.
   It also lets sites define command name and parameter syntax variants.

3) There is a need for another kind of lable, one which labels environment state under
   time-machine control.  For *this* I'd use a label command and label parameteres.

   This cabability basically lets you define 'latest-good' labels which are under version
   control, per branch, and which are used in conjunction with -date-time specifications
   to allow you to see what versions of a branch were 'latest-good' at any point in time.
   That seems a very useful thing to me, especially if it turns out that the current
   latest-good isn't really working and you'd like to go back to the last latest good,
   which did work, and which was in effect for several days last week.  I.e.

   ws_create ... -date-time last-wednesday -label latest-good

   This, to me, is much more useful than most clearcase and visual sourcesafe labels.
   If you simply want the equivalent of VSS label capabilities, use the time alias mechanism.
