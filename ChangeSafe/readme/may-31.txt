Arol: enforce time-product uniqueness of release names, and cset naming conventions.

			    Priority 31-MAY-2000 Deliverables
			    =================================

-------------------------------------------	-------	-------
CLI COMMAND					WHO	STATUS
-------------------------------------------	-------	-------

ADMIN_DATABASE_CREATE
						Bill	Done
    (1) Was known to require a trailing "/" on database directory name.  Now fixed???
						Dave	Done(Jack Notified)
    (2) Documentation needs to reflect restrictions on existing-directory checks for
        remote databases, and in fact a considerable amount of documentation needs to be
        added for remote database management.  Coordinate with Jack.
	(Have some in conman\remote-databases.html)
						Bill	TBD (DEFERRED TO JUNE)
    (3) Make FULLY spec compliant.
        I.e. directory must exist to create database, no check for clean directory is
        made, and and no checks of any form are made if the database is remote.

CO						
						Ade	Done
    Send email.  Give warnings about other checkouts.  As per spec.
    From userid is the user who invoked the command.
						JRM	Done
    See related performance task specific to CO.
						JRM	Done.
    CO is still emitting "no test implemented to ensure file is R/O on disk"
    Needs to be fixed (presumably need to check r/o status).  First pass: create backup
    file if not r/o.  Second pass: diff, backup only if not equivalent to repository view.
						JRM	Partly Done (Deferred to June)
    CO is way too noisy, for example:						
	  E:\ws1\ts50>csf co version.txt load.lsp
	  Ensuring root directory exists.
	  Composing view of versioned directory structure.
	  Creating subdirectories..
	  Publishing files...
	  Ensuring root directory exists.
	  Composing view of versioned directory structure.
	  Creating subdirectories..
	  Publishing files...
	  File checkout completed successfully.
						Ade	TBD (Low priority, Deferred)
    CO email should probably include product/subsystem information.  

CSET_ADD					Joe    DONE
    Workspace isn't updated to reflect new cset driven view.

CSET_CREATE
						JRM	Done
    (1) Do the automatic ws_update.
						JRM	DONE
    (2) cset_create with files to check out doesn't actually check out files
        NEEDED FOR 12-MAY URGENT DROP TO HP.
						JRM	Done
    (3) cset_create with files to check out publishes the whole workspace.
	(This doesn't happen with CO).   Probably because of some confusion as to the
	workspace baseline timestamp.
    (4) appears to leave the workspace in an inconsistent shape if there are checkouts
	with the cset_create.

CSET_CLOSE
						Arol	In-Progress
    (1) Process correct release scope when RELEASE_CREATE is implemented.
						TBD	TBD
    (2) Was known not to work correctly unless executed from workspace root directory.
        Still a problem, reported by HP when doing a cset_close from a subsys directory.
	Ensure that test is added to regressions too.
						Peter	In-progress
    (3) allow setting of time/userid via secret parms which are secretly server config'ed.
        See also master_change.
        [this is basically done but there are complications that prevent its use at this 
        time -- unbound variables on a branch object during a check-out operation.  Dave
        will talk to HP]
                                                Peter   Done
    (4) Disallow two csets which would have the same fully qualified name.
	Affects master_change too, indirectly.
						Dave	Done
    (5) For 12-MAY: don't abort txn if no changes to a file, abort only if no changes period.

CSET_REMOVE					Joe	DONE
    Workspace isn't updated to reflect new cset driven view.

CSET_UNCREATE					Ade	In-Progress
    Only works if there is no change in the workspace

CSETS_FROM_FILE					Peter	Done
    Implement and test.

    NEEDED FOR DATA MIGRATION FOR HP FROM ADC TO CSF

DESCRIPTION_QUERY                               Peter	Done (some deferrals noted)
    CLASS, CSET, PRODUCT, RELEASE, and SUBSYSTEM Peter	Done

    DATABASE, LABEL, TRANSACTION and WORKSPACE remain to be done.  ABSTRACT files also
    need to be done.  Not documented at this time.

    Implemented as a test mechanism for DESCRIPTION_REPLACE.
    Same priority as DESCRIPTION_REPLACE.

DESCRIPTION_REPLACE				Peter	Done
    DESCRIPTION_REPLACE CLASS, CSET, PRODUCT, SUBSYSTEM    Peter   Done
    Added RELEASE to the supported list         Peter   Done
    Implement and test.
						Peter	Deferred 
    DATABASE, LABEL, TRANSACTION and WORKSPACE remain to be done.  ABSTRACT files also
    need to be done.  Documentation may need updating.
    Low priority, could leave for V2.

FILE_ADD					Dave	Done
    Documentation (coordinate with Jack)
    -FORCE parameter needs to be removed from documentation, it isn't going
    to be supported (a FILE_RESTORE command will be added in V2).

FILE_RENAME					Dave	Done
    Documentation (coordinate with Jack)
    -FORCE parameter needs to be removed from documentation, it isn't going
    to be supported (a FILE_RESTORE command will be added in V2).

MASTER_CHANGE
						Dave	Done
    (1) Complete processing of wall processing based on WALL_* release manager commands.
						Arol	In-Progress
    (2) Resolve release scope when RELASE_CREATE is supported.

						Bill	Done
    (3) Yank reference directory updates from this command. see also product_create and subsys_create.
						Peter	In-progress
    (4) allow setting of time/userid via secret parms which are secretly server config'ed.
        See also cset_close and miscellaneous work.
        [this is basically done but there are complications that prevent its use at this 
        time -- unbound variables on a branch object during a check-out operation.  Dave
        will talk to HP]
						TBD	Deferred to June
    (5) Add a "-update" switch which governs the automatic ws_update (and implement the
        automatic update).  'no update' behavior is the default, and we signal an error
        that the workspace isn't up to date if -update wasn't specified and one is required.

MASTER_UNLOCK_FORCE
						Ade	Done
    Looks implemented, needs a test.
						Ade	Done
    Send email to locked subsystem owner who just lost his/her lock.
    From userid is the user who invoked the command.

PORT						Mark	Done
    (1) Finish back end. 
    [2000-05-23 naha: Finished.  Difficult to test extensively.
    Requires further testing.  There are probably bugs.]

						Mark	In-Progress
    (2) Bug reported by Jack (june 2), ERR_WRITE_DURING-READONLY, whatever.

						Mark	Deferred to June
    (3) Implement regression driven capability testing    

PRODUCT_CREATE
						Bill	Done
    (1) -COPY-FILE <yyyy> not yet supported.
						TBD	TBD (JDT: Defer?)
    (2) -DATE-TIME probably isn't semantically correct, (HP question #74 TBR next meeting)
						Bill	In-Progress
    (3) -PRODUCT-DIRECTORY path argument goes away
        Don't create/update the reference directory. See also master_change and subsys_create.

PRODUCT_DEACTIVATE				TBD	TBD (JDT: Defer? Needs investigation)
    Active bit shouldn't be versioned.  No csets used to manipulate it.

RELEASE_CREATE					Arol	In-Progress
    (1) Implement this command.
    (2) Fix the following commands which need to accept release specs:
	product_create
	product_directory_move
	product_directory_regenerate
	subsys_create
	subsys_subscriber_list
	ws_create
	ws_set
	+ all new commands which accept release specs in the release manager commands.
    (3) release names must be unique over time, like product, class, and subsystem names.
        This is a change from the original implementation.
    (4) release names should have the same restrictions as cset-names for valid characters

RELEASE_FREEZE					Arol	In-Progress
    Implement command and test.


RELEASE_RENAME					Peter	Done
    Implement command and test.

SUBSYS_CREATE					
						Mark	Done
    (1) -BASE-PRODUCT not implemented.
	Should be trivial, since it works like source subsystems.
	[Done.  2000-05-23 naha]
						TBD	TBD (Defer)
    (2) -DATE-TIME needs testing.
						Mark	Done
    (3) Subsys-name argument is not compliant with spec.
	Spec calls for optional positional subsystem arguement,
	whereas we currently require this as a positional argument.
	*** [2000-06-01 naha] There is an open issue with this and any
	*** other automatically synthesized naming: what should be
	*** done if the resulting name is already in use?

						TBD	TBD (Defer)
    (4) Subsystem cset derivation from pre-existing subsystems needs more tests.
        I'd like to have a QA person on this...
	[2000-06-04 naha: much of this is tested in CONMAN::TEST-16A]

						Mark	Done
    (5) The -SUBDIRECTORY argument isn't yet implemented and tested.
						Bill	Done
    (6) Don't update product reference directory, this is now obsolete 'push' behavior.

SUBSYS_SUBSCRIBER_LIST				Bill    Done
    Don't update product reference area when we add/remove subsystems from subscriber.
    I'm guessing we were forgetting to do this anyway.  This reflects spec changes which
    obsolete the 'push' model in favor of a 'pull' model.

UNCO							FIXED
						Arol	Fixed
    (1) CO->UNCO->CO again on the same file, the last CO will tell you it's already checked out.
						Arol	Fixed
    (2) Backup of file is not made if you UNCO a single file.  UNCO -ALL works (creates backup).

UNDO						Bill	Done
    (1) FILE_RENAME doesn't work unless the file was just added.
    (2) FILE_REMOVE not yet supported.
						Bill	In-Progress (Deferrable, but WAY overdue)
    (3) Deliver document describing UNDO behaviors.

WALL_HOLE					Dave	Done
    Implement command and test.  See also MASTER_CHANGE.

WALL_LOWER					Dave	Done
    Implement command and test.  See also MASTER_CHANGE.

WALL_RAISE					Dave	Done
    Implement command and test.  See also MASTER_CHANGE.

WS_CREATE					
						Peter	Done
    (1) Write .conman file first, before populating rest of workspace,
    so that other commands like ws_regenerate will work if disk population fails.
    Particularly important if we keep -ws-id behavior (since that has key to workspace),
    though we may eliminate ws-id.
    [1999-05-23 naha: Easier said than done.  There are many chickens
    that need to be wedged back into their shells as well as eggs that
    need to be prematurely hatched in order to pull this one off.]
    [2000-06-05 pww: Only the .conman file is being written earlier.  No attempt has been 
    made to change the use of ws-id's to pathnames]

						Bill	In-progress
    (2) Add a -PRODUCT-DIRECTORY argument to WS_CREATE for the reference-area equivalent.
    The bulk of this implementation in terms of enforcing reference workspaces is left
    until June.
						Joe	TBD (Deferred)
    (3) There is a problem with the attrib settings in the .conman-prefs for some windows users.
    This appeared to work, but didn't actually give me readonly files after the checkout.
    This is a sun-jvm specific problem in our implementation, since the ms jvm doesn't use
    this stuff.

    SET_FILE_READ_ONLY     C:\\WinNT\\System32\\Attrib.exe +R
    SET_FILE_READ_WRITE    C:\\WinNT\\System32\\Attrib.exe -R
    This caused massive command failures in shelling out the attrib (error text lost)
    SET_FILE_READ_ONLY     C:\WinNT\System32\Attrib.exe +R
    SET_FILE_READ_WRITE    C:\WinNT\System32\Attrib.exe -R

    TO DO:

      a) Sun jvm works for NT and unix command lines.  'conman\csf.bat' is updated to be
      in a form such that the sun jvm client will work given appropriate program
      definitions as defined in .conman-prefs, which should also be NT friendly.

      An equivalent test for #1 for MS jvm is up to you, but I definitely want to know the
      sun jvm works.

      b) Readonly bits and time stamps are set, and if there are problems invoking the
      programs, we return error codes visible to the user.

      c) At least one regression test ensures that the 'csf' or 'csf.bat' scripts are
      executed as they would be by the user, and not with the un-user-ish way they're
      invoked now, so that we can regress this capability once it's working (since we're
      clearly not detecting broken product behavior in regressions now with respect to
      file attribute capabilities.)

    (4) Ws_create fails oddly if you leave off the workspace name.  This may or may not
    be because it picks up stale .conman stuff.

						PWW/JRM	Done
    (5) ws_create with -date-time now fails according to HP.

						JRM     Done(?)
    (6) ws_create is creating strangely named zero length files in the parent of the ws directory
	because some shell quoting or something is messed up in processing the file
	"ACM Ada Letters XIII, 5 (Sep-Oct 1993), 43-47.htm" in the utility directory.

WS_MOVE						PWW	Done
    Implement and test.  Lower priority if we don't fix the -WS-ID behavior in favor of
    pathname-keyed workspaces.
    Completed with caveats: you can't be in (current directory) thge old workspace, the
    database transaction is committed before and filesystem rename is done, we are using
    the Java renameTo function to do the move, so it probably will not work across
    filesystems.  If anything goes wroong during the filesystem phase, it will be up to
    the user to fix it by hand.

WS_QUERY					NAHA	DONE

WS_REGENERATE					Bill	In-Progresss (22 May, now 1 June)
    Implement and test.  Candidate for V2 or June, not as high a priority for may-31.

WS_SET
						TBD	TBD (Deferrable)
    (1) Not deleting past product file structure, only adds/updates (low priority)
						JRM	Done
    (2) Not handling workspace VPB correctly if change-add/remove effects are present
        (high priority)
        [2000-05-23 naha: The behavior is apparently that if you do a
        ws_set your added and removed csets are lost.  This might well be
        the correct behavior since it results in the workspace matching
        its baseline.]
        [2000-6-4 jdt: WS-SET should blow away VPB, this is the correct behavior.]

						Ade	Done (verified to work)
    (3) Not creating logical subsystem directory substructure if there are no files
        present in the subsystem view. (medium priority)
						Ade	Done (verified to work)
    (4) Deletes wild files in subsystems and shouldn't. (fixed?)
						Ade	Implemented but no regression test
    (5) -FORCE needs to be implemented (high priority)
						JRM	Done
    (6) Update workspace baseline time-stamp (high priority)
						TBD	TBD(MAYBE DEFER)
    (7) in subsystem mapped to pcl/src:
	a) mkdir old, b) touch old/foo.txt c) add-file old/foo.txt (implies cset)
        d) d) master-change, e) touch old/bar.txt (wild file) f) cset-create,
	g) remove-file old/foo.txt (BREAKS)

WS_UPDATE
						JRM	Done
    (1) Handle subsystem additions/removals
						Arol	In-Progress
    (2) Process release scope correctly when RELEASE_CREATE is implemented.
						Mark	Done
    (3) -DATE-TIME behavior isn't yet implemented.
						JRM	Done
    (4) Update the workspace baseline reference time-stamp
						JRM	Done
    (5) Don't require a change-context to perform ws_update, it's optional

    (6)        (removing from VPB not done, not sure what to do) (DEFER TO JUNE)
        When ws_update (and maybe ws_set?, no probably not) add/delete csets to workspace which are
        reflected in an updated baseline, then we must ensure that those csets are not in
        the corresponding workspace VPB added/removed cset lists.

        In general, this check is:
	If the csets in the 'added' VPB list are present in the new baseline, then they
	may be removed from the added VPB list.

	If the csets in the 'removed' VPB list are not present in the new baseline, then
	they may be removed from the VPB list.
	
        Note, there are some edge cases, which we should probably punt on for now, with
        regard to the interaction of cset_add and cset_remove when a subsystem is added to
        the product and reflected in a ws_update.  E.g.  I have subsystems A and B, and
        did a cset_add of master cset "foo" which altered A, B, and C.  My VPB shows additions for A
        and B, not C.  An update brings C into my workspace.  One could suggest that it
        might be appropriate for the C component cset of "foo" to be brought in as well,
        but for now we'll just take what is appropriate for C in the imported context, and
        not perform any semantic meta-actions with regard to the overall intent of adding
        "foo" and later bringing in one of foo's affected subsystems (which may, or may
        not, contain the C component of "foo" at the time it's brought in and subsequently
        merged into the workspace.)

	Subsystems that are removed aren't necessarily a problem, only added subsystems.	
    
-------------------------------------------	-------	-------
MISCELLANEOUS					WHO	STATUS
-------------------------------------------	-------	-------

EMAIL						ADE	TBD
    (1) The documentation in conman-server-prefs.lsp with respect to email configuration
    needs to be substantially improved, this information is used by the customer.
						ADE	TBD (Defer)
    (2) If no email smtp config, don't send mail (note in code; *finish*: want to log warning
    to sysadmin log)

SERVER CONFIG					TBD	TBD (Deferred to June)

    Support secret server configuration file binding for enabling a server to use secret
    cset_close and master_change parms to set cset date and time.

TESTING						George	Done
        (lost tested configuration information, but formula appears safe)
    (1) Test HP/UX with OS_CACHE_SIZE sizes from 128->max psr size in 64MB increments.
        Requires use and documentation of extra OS_XXX variables.  Add information to
	\ts50\hpux-install-notes.txt.
	
VERBOSITY PARAMETERS				TBD	TBD (Deferred, LOW PRIORITY)
    (1) -v0, -v1, and -v2 are not generally observed.  Low priority, though -v0 should
        minimally stop the 1-liner confirmation message, and easy and centralized change.
        Note that we should either pass an "info" stream to commands, perhaps in the
	session context, or we need a condition-based thing which signals conditions which
	don't noticeably change flow of control (like WARN).  The former seems less messy
	in some ways, but affects API's of people wanting to use it.
						Dave	Done
    (2) Coordinate with HP fact that "-v1" doesn't always imply a single line of output.
        Example: ws_create, -v1 might just report progress on a per-subsystem basis,
	where -v2 might publish all files, or all percentages.

CSET/DELTA/CHANGE TERMINOLOGY			TBD	TBD (Deferred)
    Ensure that all user-visible references to 'deltas' and 'changes' (as nouns), are
    replaced by 'cset' where appropriate.  This isn't a global replace in the case of
    'change' because there are phrases and situations expressed where 'change' is the
    nicer thing to say.  

FILE PUBLISHING					
						Joe	Better, not done.
    (1) Was too noisy in general. 
        Checkout still too noisy.
						JRM	DONE
    (2) Progress indicator should disappear except for -V2 verbosity.

WORKSPACE IDENTIFICATION			Dave    Done
    The use of ws-ids has benefits (no need for ws-move command), and drawbacks (no ws-id,
    no service).  Talk with HP, see if its a priority to remove their use for now, and
    keep them if we can.  Otherwise we have to fix it in resolving workspaces (centrally
    located code), and implement the ws_move command.

    RESOLUTION: allow ws-ids to drive workspace activities for now, display them in ws_query.

DISTRIBUTED DATABASE SUPPORT			TBD	(Defer - believed to be working,
							 still needs to be tested more)
    Feature complete, tested, and supported behavior for multiple databases,
    multiple database servers, and multiple ChangeSafe servers sharing databases.

    [2000-05-23 naha: I think this works, unless there are more
    requirements than I'm aware of.  One problem is that because of
    our limited use of blobs for storing actual datastructure, a
    repository should not be used by a ChangeSafe running on a
    different platform than that which created it.]

CONCURRENT R/W TRANSACTIONS			TBD	TBD (JDT: Defer???? Dangerous)
    Implement and test high level persistent mutex and concurrent server testing.
    There is a *finish* item in cmctl-master-change, but just about all cmctl entries will need
    this logic.

PERFORMANCE WORK			
						Joe	Done
    (1) Support time-stamps on on files
        Affects all commands that try to incrementally update directories
        including ws_update, ws_set, master_change.
						JRM	Done
    (2) CO performance is entirely unusable.
        On the lan it takes 20 secs (on keating).  

PRODUCT NAME					TBD     (??DEFER??)
    CONMAN, .conman, .conman-prefs, all need to be renamed to ChangeSafe or 'csf'.

WORKSPACE VPB BUGS				MARK	Fixed? (no obvious problem eyeing code,
								joe may have fixed, needs
								a test)
    At least one known to exist, probably more.  This one reported by HP
    cset_create, add_file, cset_close, cset_create, then co, and it didsn't work.

    [2000-06-05 naha: CONMAN::TEST-39A tests exactly this case.  It now works.
     The bug was that VPB was ignored in MASTER-CATALOG-FILE-NAMES-RESOLVER.]

WARNINGS					Mark	Done
    Warnings are not being printed to csf client! Test-34a has one example of this.
    Done, but see note in version.txt for 0.192. 


		   LOW Priority Work, possibly post-dating 31-MAY-2000
		   ===================================================

-------------------------------------------	-------	-------
CLI COMMANDS					WHO	STATUS
-------------------------------------------	-------	-------

ADMIN_DATABASE_CREATE				TBD	TBD
    Implement the -description parameter.

CSET_CREATE					TBD	TBD
    File specifications for initial checkouts give a confusing (though
    accurate) error message if instead wild files were specified. Example:
    conman-366: csf cset_create -name "initial load part 1" *.lsp
    No such file #p"REPOSITORY:CLOSOPT.LSP" in project "ts50"
    An error occurred while attempting cset creation:
    No such file #p"REPOSITORY:CLOSOPT.LSP" in project "ts50"
    conman-367: csf cset_create -name "initial load part 1"      
    Cset creation completed successfully.
    conman-368: csf file_add *.lsp
    File addition completed successfully.

UNCO						
						TBD	TBD
    (1) Doesn't notice when you specifiy files that are not in the repository.
       (i.e. ignores wild files accidentally typed in unco file list).

MASTER_CHANGE/CSET_CLOSE			Dave    Done V0.157
    print file name for files which didn't change when we report no-change condition.

UNDO						Dave    Done
    Documentation incorrectly says the command takes only one file.  Varies by undo action type.
    ACTION: confirmed with Jack, should be in next doc rev.

WS_DELETE					TBD	TBD
    (1) Can't delete a workspace by pathname yet only by ws_id.
    (This basically means you need to be IN the workspace
    or nab the ws-id out of its .conman file)  This represents a bigger picture problem,
    we should probably use pathnames as ws handles instead of ids, which is certainly HP's
    preference.  I can't remember why we thought this was hard to do.

    (2) If the workspace being deleted has an open change which adds
    a file and then renames it, the renaming of the file isn't undone 
    when the workspace is removed.

-------------------------------------------	-------	-------
MISCELLANEOUS					WHO	STATUS
-------------------------------------------	-------	-------

ABBREVIATION OF PARAMETER TAGS			AROL	TBD
    NOTE: part of alias work, to be speced.  Don't do this now.

    In general, switch and keyword argument tokens are supposed to be matched with any
    suitably non-ambiguous prefix for the command.  There is an exception which says that
    certain "special" parameter tags have single letter abbreviations which are never
    considered ambiguous.

CROSS-TRANSACTION WORK DISTRIBUTION		TBD	TBD
    Support redirection for r/o activities to r/o mvcc server from r/w server.

SYMBOLIC LINKS					TBD
    Ensure that we have some reasonable handling of these for attempts
    at file_add.

SOFTWARE AND SCHEMA COMPATIBILITY CHECKS	TBD
    Ensure that code schema levels are compatible with database schema levels.
    Some checks are already in, support/qa should test a bit further.

CSF Client					TBD
    (1) Generally fix argument merging so we don't grab incorrect values from .conman for commands
    thereby creating workspaces with name "-ws-id" and similar silliness.
    There's a detailed example in conman\to-do.txt.

    (2) Product code manager and release manager commands shouldn't pick up default
        .conman context except for master-repository

ERRORS						TBD
    Need to use conman-specific error signalling routines in *some* of the places we
    call error which predate the introduction of these routines.  *some* error calls are
    deliberate however, signalling programming errors as opposed to product-user errors.

PERFORMANCE WORK				TBD	Research
    * Heterogeneous remote cset did lists, as used in subsystems cset mirrors, will become a problem.
    * Hetero/homo-geneous cid-sets which are relocatable and persist and are efficiently
      converted to native transient cid-sets will become important.
    * DIDS: persist as PCLOS objects or do the above work, rather than calling
      encode-in-database which is always a losing prospect.
    
SUBSYSTEM ADDITION TO PRODUCT			naha	Done
    Check to make sure there aren't two subsystems in the product which will currently
    have the same subdirectory mapping.

-------------------------------------------	-------	-------
REPORTS	 					WHO	STATUS
-------------------------------------------	-------	-------

The deliverables for reports are not well defined.
The PORT front-end report/form must be rock solid.
Above and beyond that, we just need to have enough in the way of reports that we can use
the product, and we should implement those things as close to the spec as possible, since
they need to be in "First Form" at the end of June.

================================================================================

JUNE-31: No prefix match (no regexp LCS matching), instead fixed prefixes for args.
        Use the one-letter prefixes in the spec for now.

JUNE-31: HP REQUEST: Server configuration parameter (secret!) for cset_close and master_change parameters
     (also secret!) which set cset user and time.

     Needed for end of May 31.

     In progress by PWW
     This has complications.  Unbound branch objects during check-out.  Dave is talking to HP.

JUNE-31: Binary files, merge considered harmful.  Signal error on ws_update forcing
    user to uncheckout and recheckout after update. ??

    ANSWER: ws_update will error out, telling user to uncheckout and recheckout after
    update. 

    Completed by PWW	June 13 2000

JUNE-31 WS_CREATE: use a -product-directory argument (switch) which signals that this workspace is
    a product directory and not a workspace for checking out files.  Ensure that that
    co/unco, file_*, and cset_{add,remove} are not permitted in these types of workspaces.

LABEL_ASSIGN (JUNE via ALIAS - TBD)					TBD	TBD
    Zap the alist on the pc for alist/time-stamp pairs.
    NOTE: may punt on this for V1, based on phonecall with Jack 14-MAY.  See Dave before
    doing this.

LABEL_CREATE (JUNE via ALIAS - TBD)					TBD	TBD
    (1) Implement command and test AS PER SPEC.  So these are time-aliases which are product-wide
        in scope and can be assigned to only one value.

        This is achieved by a non-versioned slot on PC objects which is NOT managed under
        cset control.  I have many issues with this behavior documented in
        ts50\labels.txt, which contains what I believe to be a better proposal.
        This slot is an alist of label/time-stamp pairs, where the initial alist value is
        NIL for the time-stamp until a label_assign is performed.

    (2) Implement label parameter specs for the following commands:
	product_create
	subsys_create
	ws_create
	ws_set
	ws_update
	+ all new commands which accept release specs in the release manager commands.

						Dave	TBD
    (3) Notify Jack Cassidy of final form semantics, this was left open in meeting.
        See HP question #105.
	
JULY? Product (reference) directory management commands.
    Possibly implemented as aliases

    PRODUCT_DIRECTORY_ADD, PRODUCT_DIRECTORY_MOVE, PRODUCT_DIRECTORY_REGENERATE
    PRODUCT_DIRECTORY_REMOVE, PRODUCT_DIRECTORY_UPDATE

July: .conman-prefs ??
    Allow platform conditionalization so one can apply to multiple platforms?
    [2000-05-23 naha: This conditionalization should happen at the
    time the client is installed, not each time it is run.
    .conman-prefs is just read using and instance of Java's Properties
    class so we don't have any control of the syntax of that file.]

    Automatic network server discovery by client?

JUNE: ws_query should show cset_add/remove/port effects.
