So you wanna get started.

1.  Make sure you have the basic Lispworks installed on your system.

2.  Check the parameters in  rebuild-environment.bat  and ensure
    that the values of LISPWORKS_DIRECTORY, LISPWORKS_BASE_IMAGE,
    DERIVED_IMAGE_PATH, DERIVED_IMAGE_NAME, and BUILD_SCRIPT are
    appropriate (they should default to reasonable values unless
    you are doing something weird or didn't install lispworks in
    the default location).

3.  Run rebuild-environment.bat
    This should start lispworks twice.  Each time it will dump an
    image to DERIVED_IMAGE_PATH (default is same directory as
    lispworks) csf-devel-console and csf-devel-gui are the default
    names.

4.  Use either one as your development lisp.  You shouldn't need
    to rebuild lispworks too often (only when a package is added).

5.  To start developing, start one of the development images.

6.  Make sure your `current directory' is your workspace root.
    (Start the image from that directory!)

7.  (load "build\\lwboot.lsp")  to get the system loaded.

8.  Use the system browser or just load the system.

NOTE:  Here is the order of files.

rebuild-environment.bat  takes a raw lisp image and loads lwrebuild.lisp

  lwrebuild.lsp performs the following:
    1.  Loads the patches.

    2.  Forces the compiler to always do tail-recursion elimination.

    3.  Create the CSF/CONFIG and CSF/UTILITY packages.

    4.  Loads the package definition files for third-party code.
        - ansi-series
        - lisp-server-pages

    5.  Loads packages.lsp, which is the package definition file for 
        changesafe.

    6.  Loads `utility\replacement-macros.lsp' to fixup the basic
        macros before compiling the third-party code.

    7.  Compiles and loads the third-party code.
 
    8.  Installs the `series' package.

    9.  Dumps the image.

When starting the new image, the packages and third-party code should
be set up, but there will be no changesafe code.  The file lwboot.lsp
should be loaded.

  lwboot.lsp performs the following:

    1.  Determines the workspace root (assumes it is the directory
        *above* where lwboot.lsp resides).

    2.  Sets up the pathname translations for the CSF logical host.

    3.  Load "build\lwsystem.lsp"

The file "build\lwsystem.lsp" contains the system definition for the
rest of changesafe.





Tips:
 
  Put a `shortcut' in
      Start/Programs/Xanalys LispWorks 4.2/
  that points to the `rebuild-environment.bat' file.  Rebuilding
  the environment will be a snap.

  Put a `shortcut' in
      Start/Programs/Xanalys LispWorks 4.2/
  that points to the console and the gui development images.

  Add this to your .lispworks file:

(let* ((config-package (find-package "CSF/CONFIG"))
       (boot-file      (probe-file "build\\lwboot.lsp")))
  (when config-package
    (mapc (lambda (entry)
	    (set (intern (car entry) config-package) (cadr entry)))
	  `(("*DEBUG-NOISE-LEVEL*"          0)
	    ;; add other parameters here
            ))
    (import (intern "*DEBUG-NOISE-LEVEL*" (find-package "CSF/UTILITY"))
	    (find-package "CL-USER"))
    (when boot-file
      (format t "~&Loading boot file...")
      (load boot-file))))
