;;;; Continued fraction arithmetic
;;;
;;;
;;; ``... the problem of finding the continued
;;;   fraction for a sum from the continued fractions
;;;   representing the addends is exceedingly complicated,
;;;   and unworkable in computational practice.''
;;;
;;;                     --A. YA. KHinchin, 1935
;;;
;;; Well, it is *more* complicated than simple addition, but it really
;;; isn't that hard at all.
;;;
;;; This implements simple arithmetic on continued fractions as described
;;; by Gosper in
;;;
;;; http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/hbaker/hakmem/cf.html
;;;   and
;;;
;;; http://www.tweedledum.com/rwg/cfup.htm
;;;
;;;
;;; Notes
;;; 1.  Equality is non-decidable with continued fractions.
;;;
;;; 2.  Some continued fractions don't converge, the process may get
;;;     stuck.  Example: (cf:* sqrt-two sqrt-two)  will not produce
;;;     2.   It can't decide between 1.99999 or 2.00000 until it reaches
;;;     the end of the (infinite) stream.
;;;
;;; 3.  If continued fractions were held by a structure, rather than as
;;;     a stream of coefficients, a print-method could be defined on them.
;;;     However, they couldn't easily be printed in a conforming manner
;;;     because the exactness prefix is supposed to be printed first, but
;;;     exactness can't be determined a-priori.  You find out when you
;;;     run out of coefficients.
;;;
;;; 4.  More complicated functions could be defined, (like sqrt), using
;;;     standard formulae, but performance is greatly improved if you can
;;;     express these formulae as functions on the state variables in
;;;     the gosper-1 and gosper-2 routines.
;;;
;;; 5.  This implements CFs with integer coefficients.  If you are
;;;     so inclined, you can use matrices as coefficients.  Then you
;;;     enter the realm of moebius transforms.  It allows you a cleaner
;;;     mechanism for implementation, but the math is much hairier
;;;     (you end up with tensors and stuff).  The code below should be
;;;     easy for someone with a background in calculus.
;;;
;;; 6.  This is somewhat bummed for speed.
;;;
;;; 7.  Try computing this function (from Muller):
;;;
;;;     a0 = 11/2
;;;
;;;     a1 = 61/11
;;;
;;;                           3000
;;;                  1130 - --------
;;;                           an-2
;;;     an = 111 - ------------------
;;;                   an-1
;;;
;;;     (imagine that the n-1 and n-2 are subscripts)
;;;
;;;     The answer converges to 6, but if you use floating point, it will
;;;     converge to 100.  (even if you use an enormous amount of precision!)
